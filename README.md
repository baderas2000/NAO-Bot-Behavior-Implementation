## NAO Bot Behavior Implementation

The goal of this work is to explore the benefits that the usage of robots can bring to
Design Thinking workshops. Reviewing real-life scenarios in domains of the manufacturing
industry, health care, and education, the study suggests which benefits of robots are
applicable to the Design Thinking workshops. The thesis develops an application scenario,
where a humanoid robot acts as an avatar for a remote participant, making it possible
for them to engage fully in the workshop activities. To demonstrate the reasonability
of the scenario, a proof-of-concept implementation simulates the behavior of the remote
participant who uses the NAO robot as an avatar. The work is concluded with a discussion
of the potential that robots have in revolutionizing Design Thinking workshops, namely,
by removing geographical barriers, enhancing the sense of presence for participants, and
improving overall collaboration and Collective Intelligence.
